                        <p>The pharmaceutical industry is always has been the critical industry in every country. India is the world leader in the production of the Ayurveda medicines, generic drugs and different vaccines. But according to the World Health Organization (WHO), 40% of the fake drugs sold all over the world come from India. With the help of our project our main goal is to reduce the counterfeiting of drugs, solve theft issues and enhance stock management. We have implemented blockchain technology as our main domain for this project. Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records and transfer data in a fast, secure and transparent manner. The blockchain can document critical details like location and temperature from IoT devices attached to the packages. In this way the system becomes visible to the all concerned entities while greatly reducing the possibility of record tampering. In the supply chain each entity will receive the package, verify it and add his digital signature. The consumers just have to scan the QR code on the product and they can check if the drug is original or not which gives them confirmation about the medicine. As result, our system effectively improves the transparency of data in the supply chain, increases the safety of medicines, reduces manual operation, eliminates unnecessary entry points in the chain and gives confirmation about the medicine to the consumers.</p>
